		<h2>My Journal</h2>
		
		<p>As a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science
		in Information Technology, I find myself standing at the 
		crossroads of academia and the imminent entry into the 
		dynamic and ever-evolving industry of IT. This juncture 
		prompts me to envision my life five years from now, 
		contemplate my aspirations, and reflect on the worthiness 
		of the journey I'm undertaking.</p>
		
		<p>Despite my initial uncertainty about why I ended up in
		the field of information technology, my present commitment 
		to continue on this path is unwavering. This choice is based
		on my belief that there is a God's plan directing my life. 
		The stress and pressure I've been subjected to in recent 
		months, and expect in the next weeks, are considered as 
		opportunities to shape me into a resilient and capable 
		professional.</p>
		
		<p>Looking ahead, I see myself effectively transitioning
		into the IT professional setting. I envision myself making
		a significant contribution to the industry, with an 
		emphasis on front-end developmentâ€”a decision motivated 
		by my self-awareness as a third-year student, who recognizes
		the gaps in my expertise. While I acknowledge that my 
		present skill set is limited, I am motivated to get the 
		essential practical knowledge and hands-on abilities via 
		continual study.</p>
		
		<p>The notion of entering the workforce causes me anxiety, 
		especially given my perceived insufficiency of present
		abilities. However, I refuse to give in to my fear of 
		rejection. Instead, I want to focus my job search on 
		opportunities that match my existing skills, allowing 
		for progressive growth and learning. I understand that my
		journey in IT is a continuing one, and I am open to the 
		possibility of more education and skill development 
		even after graduation.</p>
		
		<p>While I understand the pressure that comes with starting 
		a new job, I prefer to see this change as an opportunity for 
		personal and professional development. I envision a future 
		in which my salary reflects the value of my abilities and 
		contributions to the industry. I desire to be a front-end 
		developer, fully aware that the path to this position would 
		take time, and I am committed to progressing at 
		my own pace.</p>
				
		<p>In conclusion, my path in IT is more than a means to a
		goal; it is a continual process of self-discovery and growth.
		The difficulties and uncertainties are not roadblocks but 
		rather stepping stones toward a rewarding and successful 
		profession. As I enter the field of IT, I welcome the unknown, 
		aware that each encounter will help me grow as a talented 
		and resilient worker.</p>
